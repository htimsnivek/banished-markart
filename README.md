Markarts is a mod for [Banished](http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/game/).
It adds miniature specialised markets: markarts. [They use the storage cart model
(2x2)](http://i.imgur.com/tSdvogx.png), require a single vendor to operate and have a storage capacity of 1000
units. Each costs 6 wood, 2 stone, 3 iron and 7 work to build.

**Disclaimer:** I used it a couple of hours without problems and it should be
compatible with existing saves. That said, use at your own risks. I am not
responsible if it corrupts your saves, blow up your screen or transform your
puppy in something green and sticky.


Citizen Markarts
----------------
These markarts are intended to replace regular markets, they have a radius of
22 (about half of a regular market) and can sustain around 10 houses each.

* **Food Markart** Stocks food.
* **Food Markart #** Stocks food (except cereals). Can be used to produce wheat
ale more reliably. Be careful not to grow corn if using it.
* **Consumable Markart** Stocks tools, clothes, herbs and fuel.
* **Consumable Markart #** Stocks tools, clothes, herbs and firewood. Allows you
to save coal for blacksmiths.

Artisan Markarts
----------------

These markarts are designed to gather resources for your artisans to increase
productivity, they do not have a radius so citizens won't touch them provided a
market/markart is in range.

* **Blacksmith Markart** Stocks wood, iron and coal.
* **Tailor Markart** Stocks textiles.
* **Wood Markart** Stocks wood.
* **Tavern Markart** Stocks wheat. Use in conjunction with *Food Markart #* to produce ale more reliably.

Known issues
------------

* When placed, markarts show as 2x2 squares without the arrows to indicate access is required. You do however need at least one side free. *[fix is worse than current situation]*
* Citizen sometime take resources from no-radius markarts if in direct contact with their house. *[cannot fix]*
* Tailor markart will be filled indiscriminately with leather and wool rather than 50% of each. *[cannot fix]*
